# ATM-Interface
This ATM interface project is developed as a frontend simulation to practice DOM manipulation and basic logic building using Vanilla JavaScript. It provides a clean UI that resembles a typical ATM screen and allows users to interact with features such as:

🔐 PIN authentication simulation

💰 Balance checking

➕ Deposit amount

➖ Withdraw funds

🧾 Transaction alerts and validations

It’s entirely front-end based and does not connect to a real database — all transactions are simulated in-memory for demonstration purposes.
